# Legilimens Starter
This is **not affiliated** with [Legilimens](https://github.com/Malin001/Legilimens-Hogwarts-Legacy-cpp) or [Hogwarts Legacy Save Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/1983)

This program automates the process of decompressing save files with HLSaveTool before running Legilimens on them.
# Why?
Decompressing the save files is necessary, but it detracts from the convenience that Legilimens aims to provide. Legilimens Starter streamlines the process to make it more convenient.

# Setup
If you don't have them already, download Hogwarts Legacy Save Tool from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/1983), as well as Legilimens either from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/mods/556) (use the executable version) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Malin001/Legilimens-Hogwarts-Legacy-cpp)

For this to work, you need the following file structure:
`📁 (Root Folder)  
	├── 📁 HLSaveTool  
		└── hlsaves.exe  
	├── Legilimens.exe  
	└── LegilimensStarter.exe (you can rename this)  `

Then, run LegilimensStarter and follow the instructions.
